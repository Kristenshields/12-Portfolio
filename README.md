# React Portfolio

## Overview

The React Portfolio project showcases my web development skills, focusing on creating a dynamic, responsive, and modern portfolio site using React. This portfolio serves as a personal space to share my work, reflect my experience, and connect with potential clients, employers, and other developers. It demonstrates my ability to build and deploy projects using the latest web technologies.

## Project Features

### Responsive Design: 
Built with a mobile-first approach to ensure the portfolio looks great on any device.

### React Components: 
Utilizes reusable components to build the different sections of the portfolio, such as the About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume sections.

### Modern Styling: 
Styled using CSS to create a polished, visually appealing layout, with transitions and hover effects for an engaging user experience.

### Routing with React Router: 
Allows seamless navigation between different sections of the portfolio, including About Me, Projects, Contact, and Resume.

### Deployment:
 The portfolio is deployed using Netlify.
